\Subject { Since the late 2010s, the satellite communications industry has gone through a paradigm shift with the rise of large non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) megaconstellations. This shift, fuelled by reduced space launch costs and the widespread use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology, has ushered in a new era of broadband connectivity with truly ubiquitous availability of high-quality network access. Going forward, NGSO megaconstellations are likely to play a crucial role as a complementary solution for terrestrial mission-critical networks. The rapid proliferation of commercial satellite solutions has not been without its challenges, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. The absence of widely accepted cybersecurity standards, coupled with the proprietary nature of the technology, leave satellite systems open to potential vulnerabilities. Instances of interception and intentional interference have been demonstrated in the literature using readily available and affordable radio equipment, accessible even to hobbyists. In this context, this thesis investigated the threat posed by airborne adversaries to the uplink communications of a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) interfacing with a megaconstellation in low Earth orbit (LEO). A research framework comprising four submodels was developed with the models examining VSAT interception range, beam tracking potential for airborne eavesdroppers, interception windows, and the active threat of jamming. Findings were examined from the perspective of mission-critical communications, and they proved the physical resilience of NGSO VSAT systems against signal interception and intentional jamming, with the distributed infrastructure of NGSO systems offering many inherent advantages. Therefore, commercial LEO megaconstellations offer new capabilities and enhance existing ones, even in the demanding fields of public safety and defence. However, their integration into critical communications infrastructure requires care due to the stringent cybersecurity requirements in these markets. }
