\Subject { In recent years, the satellite communications industry has witnessed a paradigm shift with the rise of large Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit (NGSO) megaconstellations. This shift, fuelled by reduced space launch costs and the widespread use of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology, has ushered in a new era of global connectivity. In the future, commercial satcom systems are likely to play a crucial role as a complementary solution for terrestrial mission-critical networks, addressing distinct set of use cases varying in their nature, duration, and forecastability. In practice, the potential applications range from serving traditionally underserved rural and maritime regions to providing vital connectivity during planned events and responding swiftly to unplanned incidents such as natural disasters. The rapid proliferation of commercial satellite solutions has not been without its challenges, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. The absence of widely accepted cybersecurity standards, coupled with the proprietary nature of satellite solutions, leaves open potential vulnerabilities. For example, the ubiquitous broadcast nature of satellite transmissions further exposes them to eavesdropping and adversarial actions across wide geographic footprints. Adversarial groups, spanning state actors to individual enthusiasts armed with accessible Software-Defined Radios (SDR), have demonstrated the feasibility of interception deliberate interference with commercial satellite systems. This thesis investigated the threat posed by airborne adversaries to Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) interfacing with satcom megaconstellations in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). A comprehensive research framework comprising four submodels was developed with the models examining VSAT interception ranges, airborne eavesdropper tracking potential, temporal considerations for capturing RF data, and the active threat of jamming. Findings showed the physical resilience of NGSO VSAT systems against signal interception and intentional jamming, with the distributed infrastructure of NGSO systems offering many inherent advantages. Satellite networks have great potential to enable new capabilities in traditionally tough-to-serve use cases in the fields of public safety and defence. Proper care in their integration needs to be taken as robust cybersecurity measures are a key starting point in these markets. }
